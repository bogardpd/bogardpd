<p>I travel reasonably often, and I consider myself a bit of a transportation nerd. It’s only logical that I would keep track of where I’ve flown.</p>

<p>For a while, I used a giant text file, and later an Excel spreadsheet, to track all of my flights; I created maps manually using the <a href="http://www.gcmap.com/">Great Circle Mapper</a>. But by the time my flights began numbering in the hundreds, I needed a more automated solution, so I created <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/">Paul Bogard’s Flight Log</a>.</p>

<h2>Flights</h2>

<p>The most prominent item on the <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/flights">flights listing</a> is a pair of maps showing every flight I’ve taken since age 18.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/B-1.png" alt="Maps of all flights.">
</figure>

<p>I have a database of all the flights I’ve taken, and I wrote some code to take all of this flight route data and transform it into a format that the the <a href="http://www.gcmap.com/">Great Circle Mapper</a> understands, and the Great Circle Mapper generates me a map like the one above. This means that when I add a new flight to the database, my maps are updated automatically.</p>

<aside>(As an aside, when I add a flight to the database, it’s hidden at first – only I can see it. This allows me to enter my flights without having the general public aware that I’m traveling until I return home and unhide those flights.)</aside>

<p>Of course, while maps are useful, sometimes more details are needed, and for that I’ve included a listing of all of my flights.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/B-2.png" alt="A table of all flights.">
  <figcaption>Note: I later discovered that several flights in this and other screenshots were mistakenly listed as Continental when they were actually on American Airlines. This has been corrected in the Flight Log.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Clicking on any flight in the list brings up a <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/flights/147">flight details page</a>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/B-3.png" alt="A map and flight details for American Airlines 1231 on 4 June 2012.">
</figure>

<p>This page shows a map of the flight and a number of details. Many of these details are links – so clicking on <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/classes/first">first class</a>, for example, brings you to a page listing all of my first class flights. The page also shows some maps of trips (and parts of trips) which have a flight involving these two cities, so this is as good of a time as any to describe how trips work.</p>

<h2>Trips</h2>

<p>At its core, a trip is a complete set of flights, from an origin airport, with a stop at one or more destinations. Often, but not always, the final destination is the same as the origin, which in everyday speech is a “round trip.”</p>

<p>For the purpose of my flight log, a trip can be divided into one or more sections. A section is simply all the flights between the origin and the first destination, or between any two consecutive destinations. So, let’s say that I have a round trip from my home in the Dayton, Ohio area to Los Angeles, with a layover at Dallas/Fort Worth both ways. This trip would then have two sections – the first containing all of my flights to Los Angeles (the <abbr title="Dayton">DAY</abbr> to <abbr title="Dallas/Fort Worth">DFW</abbr> flight and the <abbr title="Dallas/Fort Worth">DFW</abbr> to <abbr title="Los Angeles">LAX</abbr> flight) and the second containing all of my flights home (the <abbr title="Los Angeles">LAX</abbr> to <abbr title="Dallas/Fort Worth">DFW</abbr> flight and the <abbr title="Dallas/Fort Worth">DFW</abbr> to <abbr title="Dayton">DAY</abbr> flight)</p>

<p>If I had a multi-city trip from Dayton to Los Angeles to Seattle to Dayton, there would be three sections – All flights between <abbr title="Dayton">DAY</abbr> and <abbr title="Los Angeles">LAX</abbr>, all flights between <abbr title="Los Angeles">LAX</abbr> and <abbr title="Seattle">SEA</abbr>, and all flights between <abbr title="Seattle">SEA</abbr> and <abbr title="Dayton">DAY</abbr>.</p>

<p>All that said, clicking on the Trips link at the top of any Flight Log page will show a <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/trips">list of trips</a>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/B-4.png" alt="A listing of trips in chronological order.">
</figure>

<p>Clicking on any of those will show a <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/trips/55">trip details page</a>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/B-5.png" alt="Trip details for a trip to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Rapid City, South Dakota showing a map and a list of six flights.">
</figure>

<p>This particular trip was a multi-city trip, starting and ending in Dayton with stops in Oklahoma City and Rapid City. As you can see, the map highlights destinations with a ring around a dot, while airports that are simply layovers are just shown as a black dot.</p>

<p>Below the map, all the flights for this trip are shown, grouped by trip section. Clicking any of the airlines and flight numbers will bring up the flight details page as described above. If you’d like to just see one particular section of the trip, clicking the section number to the left of the flights will do so:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/B-6.png" alt="Details for the first section of the Oklahoma City and Rapid City trip, showing a map and flights from Dayton to Dallas/Fort Worth to Oklahoma City.">
</figure>

<h2>Airports</h2>

<p>On my <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/airports">airports listing</a>, I start out with some maps showing all airports I’ve been to, but the heart of the page is the list of airports.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/C-1.png" alt="A table of airports, sorted in order of how many times Paul has visited them.">
</figure>

<p>This lists each airport I’ve been to, and the number of times I’ve visited it. The number of visits is automatically determined from the flight data in the database; every flight has an airport visit at either end of it.</p>

<p>My code also has to look at trip sections to determine if a flight arriving at an airport and the next flight departing from the same airport is a layover or not. If both flights are in separate sections (for example, I land in Dallas/Fort Worth, do some business there, and then depart from <abbr title="Dallas/Fort Worth">DFW</abbr> later) it is not a layover and counts as two visits. However, if they’re in the same section, it’s a layover, and only counts as a single visit.</p>

<p>This visit calculation is how I determined when my 100th airside visit to the Dayton airport, allowing me to celebrate accordingly.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/C-2.jpg" alt="Paul at the Dayton airport, wearing a party hat with the number 100 on it.">
</figure>

<p>Clicking on any airport brings up its <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/airports/ORD">details</a>, starting with a list of all flights involving the airport:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/C-3.png" alt="Details for Chicago O'Hare, showing a map with all of Paul's flights involving that airport.">
</figure>

<p>The page also figures out which trip sections and trips involve the airport in question, and generates maps for those, too:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/C-4.png" alt="Details for Chicago O'Hare, showing a map with all of Paul's flights involving that airport anywhere along the trip section.">
</figure>

<p>Finally, the page shows a listing of the frequency of all the airlines and aircraft families I’ve used at this airport:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/C-5.png" alt="Tables showing all airlines and aircraft Paul has flown through Chicago O'Hare, sorted by how often each was flown.">
</figure>

<p>Clicking on any airline or aircraft family will bring up details about each.</p>

<h2>Airlines</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/airlines">airlines page</a> shows a list of airlines I’ve flown and the number of flights on each, sorted by number of flights.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/D-1.png" alt="A table of airlines, sorted in order of how many times Paul has flown them.">
</figure>

<p>When codeshares are involved, I use the airline and flight number of the operator of the flight.</p>

<p>Regional subsidiary airlines are listed as the parent airline. For example, all American Eagle flights are listed as American Airlines, and all flights branded as United Express are listed as United flights, regardless of which subsidiary airline actually operates it.</p>

<p>Airlines which have gone through a merger since my last flight are still listed as the airline they were on the date I took the flight. For example, my flights on Northwest are <em>not</em> considered Delta flights.</p>

<p>Clicking on any <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/airlines/United">airline</a> brings up a map and list of all flights I’ve taken on that airline:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/D-2.png" alt="Details for United Airlines, showing a map and listing of all of Paul's United flights.">
</figure>

<h2>Aircraft Families</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/aircraft">aircraft families page</a> shows a listing of all aircraft families I’ve flown.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/D-3.png" alt="A table of aircraft families, sorted in order of how many times Paul has flown them.">
</figure>

<p>A large portion of my flights are on regional jets; a hazard, I suppose, of living near Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<p>As expected, clicking on an aircraft family brings up a map and list of the flights using it:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/D-4.png" alt="Details for the Boeing 737 family, showing a map and listing of all of Paul's Boeing 737 flights.">
</figure>

<h2>Classes</h2>

The <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/classes">class listing</a> is one of the simplest; it’s just a table of the travel classes (first, etc.) that I’ve flown and how many flights I’ve flown on each.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/E-1.png" alt="A table of travel classes, sorted in order of how many times Paul has flown them.">
</figure>

<p>At time of this Flight Log release, the vast majority of my flights have been domestic, so I’ve rarely ever been on three-class planes. Thus, I have not yet had any flights in business class.</p>

<p>As always, clicking on one of the <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/classes/first">classes</a> shows a table and map of my flights in that class:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/E-2.png" alt="Details for first class, showing a map and listing of all of Paul's first class flights.">
</figure>

<h2>Tail Numbers</h2>

<p>Every aircraft has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_registration">unique number</a> painted on or near its tail – think of it like a license plate for an airplane.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/E-3.jpg" alt="A row of airplanes, with their tail numbers highlighted.">
</figure>

<p>Because the number is unique, if I keep track of it, I can tell whether I’ve been on a particular plane before. And, of course, this also allows me to <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/tails">track which particular aircraft I’ve flown on most often</a>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/E-4.png" alt="A table of tail numbers, sorted in order of how many times Paul has flown them.">
</figure>

<p>My tail number data is more sparse than a lot of my other categories. I didn’t begin tracking tail numbers before 2012, and even once I did, it’s not always possible to see the tail number (for example, at night, or when the airport terminal layout blocks the view of my aircraft’s tail). Still, the above listing shows me all of the aircraft that I know I’ve flown on at least once.</p>

<p>Clicking on one of the <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com/tails/N909EV">tail numbers</a> shows a list of my flights on that plane and a corresponding map:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/flight_historian/1_0/E-5.png" alt="Details for tail number N909EV, showing a map and listing of all of Paul's flights on this particular jet.">
</figure>

<p>And with that, I’ve fully described the basic functionality of the <a href="https://www.flighthistorian.com">Flight Log</a>!</p>
