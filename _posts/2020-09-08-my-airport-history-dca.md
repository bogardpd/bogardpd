Although I used to have to go to D.C./Northern Virginia for work relatively frequently back in the early 2010s, I only ever once flew into DCA to get there. Most of the time, I’d just take the 9-hour drive; the few times I flew were usually into Dulles.

Nowadays, I largely use DCA as a layover to get to one of the several airports I use (MHT, PWM, or BOS) to get to Portsmouth, New Hampshire; for whatever reason, our work travel system likes to route me through there.

DCA does have the flaw that a lot of older airports have in that it wasn’t designed with security checkpoints in mind, so it consists of a number of smaller concourses each behind their own checkpoint, and it’s crowded behind those checkpoints. That said, these airside concourses do actually have a reasonable selection of shops and restaurants relative to their size, at least in the Gates 23–34 and 35–45 concourses I routinely fly through.

DCA also has one of the most spectacular landings I’ve seen if your flight ends up taking the [River Visual](https://www.fly.faa.gov/Information/east/zdc/dca/atcCharts/DCA_CVFP_00443RIVER_VIS19.pdf) approach into the airport, where the flight follows the Potomac River from north to south right down into the airport. Pick a window seat on the left side (seat numbers ending in “A”), and if your flight ends up using that approach, you’ll have a lot of turns with a great view of the D.C. landmarks!
