<p>Some of the local neighborhoods that I go on walks through were damaged by the 2019 Memorial Day tornadoes, and I’ve gradually watched some houses be rebuilt. I had an idea of playing around with plotting the path of the property damage, so I went looking for Beavercreek, Ohio property parcel shapefiles.</p>

<p>I came across the Greene County parcel dataset, which in addition to the shapes of properties in the area had quite a bit of data about the structures – including, as it turns out, the number of bathrooms each house in the county.</p>

<p>Temporarily distracted by this newfound data, I fired up QGIS and created a map of the values of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FULL BATH</code> field, filtered by residential properties (in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CLASS</code> field).</p>
